# Instructions for Chromium WebDriver setup

## Chromium Installation (C:\chrome-win)
1. Your Chromium is already installed at C:\chrome-win
2. Download ChromeDriver matching your Chromium version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
3. Place chromedriver.exe at C:/chromedriver.exe

## Find your Chromium version:
1. Open cmd prompt and run: `C:\chrome-win\chrome.exe --version`
2. The output will show something like "Chromium 96.0.4664.45"
3. Download the matching ChromeDriver version from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

## ChromeDriver setup
1. Download the ChromeDriver version that matches your Chromium version EXACTLY
2. Place chromedriver.exe at C:/chromedriver.exe
3. The script is configured to find Chromium at C:\chrome-win\chrome.exe

## Troubleshooting WebDriver Issues
- If you encounter any issues with the webdriver:
  a) Ensure Chromium and ChromeDriver versions match exactly
  b) Try updating both to the latest version
  c) Check if Chromium can be launched manually: `C:\chrome-win\chrome.exe`
  d) Make sure Visual C++ Redistributable is installed (required by ChromeDriver)

## Installation commands to run on Windows server
# Install dependencies:
pip install selenium==4.9.1 bs4 deep_translator requests psutil

# Restart any chrome.exe processes that might be hanging:
taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe

## Script Configuration 
- Default ChromeDriver path is C:/chromedriver.exe
- Script is configured to use Chromium from C:\chrome-win\chrome.exe
- USE_CHROMIUM is set to True to enable Chromium usage

## Note on headless mode
Chromium in headless mode is much more efficient than regular Chrome:
- Uses less memory
- Consumes fewer CPU resources
- Doesn't display any windows on the remote server
- Better performance overall
